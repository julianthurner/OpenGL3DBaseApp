Setup for building:
Follow this guide https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window for easier setup
(1) Setup GLFW and link both its includes and its lib file
(2) Setup GLAD and link its includes. I chose to compile glad.c into a static library glad.lib and link it, but you can alternatively just add glad.c as one of your project files
