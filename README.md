Setup for building yourself:<br>
Look into this guide https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window for help with the setup<br>
(1) Setup GLFW and link its includes and its lib file<br>
(2) Setup GLAD and link its includes. I chose to compile glad.c into a static library glad.lib and link it, but you can alternatively just add glad.c as one of your project files<br>
Now look into this guide https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures for help with setting up STB<br>
(3) Setup STB by adding stb_image.h to your include directory<br>
